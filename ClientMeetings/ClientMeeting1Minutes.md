# Client Meeting 1 Minutes

Meeting with Zaheed Jaffar (Senior AV) and his boss Mark Pajak

## Main Requirements
- Reusable system with minimal setup where the artefacts are on a table and hotspots for the items can be moved around with minimal mapping 
- Two projections, one on the artefact displaying hotspots when someone walks up to the display and one on the wall displaying artefact information
- Client would prefer to have photo and text merged on slide, [examples of possible text](https://collections.bristolmuseums.org.uk/stories/)

## Object Details
- Originally not too small, flat objects with the aim to test the limits of possible objects that can be used
- 3D scanner and printer are available for making replicas 
- Links to museum objects, [exhibitions](https://exhibitions.bristolmuseums.org.uk), [collections](https://collections.bristolmuseums.org.uk)

## MVP
- Array of buttons which displays content when clicked
- Client happy with just using images and videos for MVP
- Wants updatable content

## Kit That We Can Borrow
- 2 projectors, one lower quality that faces down on the artefact and one standard 
- Camera, they have Azul Connects (special 3D camera) and a LIDAR camera

## Licensing
- Open source, Zaheed wants it to be accessible for other museums as the current alternatives are very pricy, wants a version which people can build upon

## Other
- Need to give Zaheed the details for the module manager so that they can speak about budgets
- Very basic version of what they want can be found in the Curiosity Gallery, uses buttons
