A project in collaboration with Bristol Museums, to allow 3-D printed replicas of artefacts to be interacted with to display detailed, rich information about the touched area.

The functionality includes a camera and 2 projectors. The first projector overlays hotspots (glowing circles) onto the 3-D printed replica of the artefact. The camera positioned next to this projector uses computer vision to detect when a user's hand touches a hotspot, and upon a delay, activates the hotspot. A second project pointed against a wall will display information pertinent to the selected hotspot. This information is displayed in a rich, multimedia format, including text, images, and video.

The system aims to be intuitive and require no prior knowledge to use, with at most only simple instructions required to make full use of the system.

The system features an editor to allow for full visual editing of hotspots, with no editing of config files or manual import of media required. The configuration can be backed up via a single, easy to manage file and later restored back to into the program. We aim for the software to be installed and ran on a small form factor computer, specifically the RaspberryPi Model 4.
