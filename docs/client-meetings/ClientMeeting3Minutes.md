# Client Meeting 3
Gave a near final release demo, main changes were:
- Feather the images being displayed 
- Invert the colour scheme of the display screen so background is black and text is white
- Change the hotspot activation time from 5 seconds to 2 seconds as visitors have a low attention span
- Write a blog about the process, example blogs can be found [here](https://www.labs.bristolmuseums.org.uk)
