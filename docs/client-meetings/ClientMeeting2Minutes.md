# Client Meeting 2 Minutes
## User Interface
- Zahid to chat internally to see what they want the interface to look like, will send us an example
- Need a black background as it is a projection
- Want to be able to change assets easily
- Suggest compressing video automatically to maybe help with buffering for high pixel rate images
- Wants to display text for however long it takes to typically read the text
- Have prompt display upon initialisation to tell visitors to select a hotspot
- Maybe display selected slide until people are no longer visible in camera view, plus a delay

## Cameras and Hotspots
- Zahid likes what we have so far
- Wants the hotspots to be hidden, then come up 1 by 1 with a sound prompt when a hand enters the area
- Wants to test with different light conditions as room will likely be somewhat dark for the projectors with the object somewhat lit up. Has cameras we can borrow (see last client minutes), thinks one may have night vision
- We will let him know after testing different light conditions which works best
- Camera will be positioned directly above artifact
- Wants to try a sound prompt when hotspot selected
- Idle mode for projector would be nice but doesn't really matter as they have projectors that can cope with just staying on
- May be hard to see unfilled circle on object, suggests:
    - reverse the fill animation so unselected is filled and selected is unfilled
    - change the colour, although white is the easiest to see, maybe to gray to white

## Other
- Artifacts that will be used are  roughly A5 size
- Will likely use a Raspberry Pi 5 in the Bristol Museum
- Is going to try and find some artifact models we can use
- Museum typically use a 1080p projector
- Still wants it to be cheap and compatible so smaller museums with little interactive displays could use it
