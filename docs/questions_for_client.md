- clarify how exactly they want it to work (there might be an element of we can work out the details ourselves)
- Will they require that we use certain hardware (be that the computer or the projector) or is it up to us?
- do they envision having the projectors installed on the walls? Maybe we can communicate with them wirelessly if tractable
- where will the computer be? It could be raspberry pi which is installed somewhere on a wall or on the floor out of the way.
- if we're projecting onto the artifact in various places and projecting onto the walls, we're going to need a bunch of projectors around the place. Also, if we're detecting presses using cameras, we're going to need a bunch of cameras around the place. The whole thing seems a bit overkill and expensive when you put it like that.
- are the hotspots all going to be on one side of the artifact, i.e. like within 90 degrees or so (assuming the artifact is roughly spherical). Then we could potentially do it all with one projector and one camera and have it all packaged up in a neat little unit.
- are we just doing the projection of the hotpots when someone is detected nearby? Or are we also doing the detection of someone pressing a hotspot and the projection of content onto the wall? In the brief it seemed like the second one was for master's students.
