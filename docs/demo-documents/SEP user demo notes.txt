- put hand palm-facing-down with fingers together over general area (not close enough)
- then pointed with index finger (still a bit far from the hotspots)
	- NB: we should make our system work with this by having the camera fairly square-on and using a large radius for the hotspot detection (but a smaller circle actually displayed to the user on the projector)
- Hand was roughly 45 degree angle from table
